Example: crumb spreading jig may be installed to spread the crumbs evenly on the conveyor so that operators do not need to spread the crumb with hands. Waste receptacles should be placed close to the operators to minimize their movement, operators should be standing in positions where they do not need to bend their bodies to pick the contaminants from the conveyor, and if the operators are required to stand at height, a safety feature to prevent falling should be available."
